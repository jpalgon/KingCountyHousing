## Overview

Hugh Honey and Vic Vinegar have decided to expand Honey and Vinegar Real Estate into King County. I have been tasked with helping Hugh and Vic navigate the King County market and maximize profits. In order to maximize profits I am going to look at which features impact the price of a King County home the most. The data source provided is from Kaggle and contains King County housing data from May 2014 until May 2015.

The two main issues for cleaning the data set was converting all the object data types into a numeric data type and imputing or removing missing data. My goal was to remove as little data as possible and carefully imputing data in the most accurate way.

Sqft_living had the highest correlation with price. Waterfront: $608,976, grade_value: $99,787 and view: $68,547 were three of the highest coefficients in my baseline model. After running my model, I compared the actual price vs my predicted price. I looked at the highest values of my predicted price subtracted by the actual price to find what actual prices may be undervalued. Waterfront, view, and the zipcodes: 98010, 98118, 98146, 98122, 98033 were the most undervalued. My recommendation for Honey and Vinegar real estate would be to focus on houses that maximize sqft_living, have high grade_values, and have a waterfront, view, or are in the 5 undervalued zipcodes.

## Business Problem

Hugh Honey and Vic Vinegar want to take their real estate prowess to King County. However, as Philadelphia residents they are not familiar with the area and would like guidance on how to conquer King County and maximize their profits for their newly founded western branch.

In order to maximize profits, Hugh and Vic need to sell as many houses as they can. Additionally, if they accurately provide their customers with homes that grow in value, they can build a reputation of making their customers happy in both the short and long term. This will help drive more customers to choose Honey and Vinegar Real Estate.

## Data

The Kaggle dataset provided was the King County Housing Data (`kc_house_data.csv`) from May 2014 until May 2015.

Cleaning the data came with two main tasks: converting all of the object data types to a numeric data type and imputing or removing missing data. All but one feature were converted to a binary or ordinal scale and some were converted both ways (ex view) to see if the binary or ordinal scale of having a view mattered more.

In order to imputing the missing data in the best possible way I dug into each of the columns to determine the best course of action. For some features, I took the most common value (yr_renovated), for others I used a scale of a correlated ordinal or binary scaled feature to best impute the missing values, and another I was able to replace the entire column of values by making a calculation from two other features (sqft_living - sqft_above = sqft_basement).

In the end I only had to remove one outlier row where bedrooms was equal to 33. Other than that single row I was able to impute for all missing values and keep all existing rows.

## Methods and Modeling

My first step in understanding was to look at features that had the highest correlation with price. Sqft_living was the top feature followed by grade_value and sqft_living15 (the sqft of living for the nearest 15 neighbors). 

My next step was to run my first linear regression model. I wanted to establish a good baseline model to pull out coefficients. Waterfront ($608,976), Grade ($99,787), View ($68,547) were among my top coefficients after running my baseline model.

I wanted to start my model as simple as possible so I just ran a linear regression on price using sqft_living (R2 = 0.49). Over 4 steps, I added some of the most important features to get an R2 = 0.70.

In my next modeling step I took the log of price and again started with just price (this time logged) using sqft_living (R2 = 0.45). While it started off lower than my first block of models after adding more important features I got an R2 = 0.77.

Next, I One Hot Encoded zipcode. With just sqft_living and zipcode One Hot Encoded my R2 = 0.72. Without any log transformations I added some of the most important features to this block and got my baseline R2 = 0.80.

I kept doing this same method on different combinations of standard price, transformed price, standard sqfts', transformed sqfts', One Hot Encoded zipcode and no One Hot Encoded zipcodes.

My best and final model using logged price, transformed sqfts' and One Hot Encoded zipcode got an R2 = 0.88.

My final step was to take the predictions of my final model and compare it to the actual prices. I wanted to look at the area where my model projected a higher price than the actual price to see what in the market might be undervalued. I found waterfront, view, and the zipcodes: 98010, 98118, 98146, 98122, 98033 to be my most undervalued features. 

## Results

### Price vs. Sqft_living
![Price vs. Sqft_living](./Images/price_vs_sqft.png)

There is a fairly linear relationship between price and sqft_living. Additionally waterfront homes have higher prices for comparable sqft_living.

### Price vs. Has a View
![Price vs. Has a View](./Images/price_vs_view.png)

There is a much wider distributions of price for houses with a view than without a view. Q3 is particularly higher in view than no view. Very strong positive linear or possibly exponential relationship between price and grade_value. Shows the reason it is one of the features. 

### Model Results

My model is able to capture 0.88 of the variance in the actual price that can be explained by its predicted price.

## Conclusions

My process was able to find the features with the highest correlation with price, the features that have the highest coefficients with price after running a baseline model, and the features that are undervalued when being compared to my final model. Therefore Honey and Vinegar Real Estate should focus on houses with high sqft_living, grade, view, and sqft_living_15 that is on a waterfront, and are in 98010, 98118, 98146, 98122, 98033 zipcodes. 

For the next steps I would like to get housing data from these houses and their prices in future years to see if my model accurately predicted what was undervalued. Additionally, I would like to explore the longitude and latitude aspects of the data to specifically plot areas within zipcodes to further hone in my recommendation.
